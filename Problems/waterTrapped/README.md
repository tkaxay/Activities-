1. Declared array for input
2. Passed that array to function watertrap
3. Declared total variable to calculate total amount of water which can be trapped
4. Used for loop to iterater over array
5. Excluding the first and last element because it will not trap any of water
6. For every number in array i used two loops to calculate right max and left max so that much amount of water it wiil trap
7. Took the minimun of it and subtracted the i^th element from that value so it will contain only that much amount  of water
8. Same for all elements and incremented the total with that min
9. Returned total
